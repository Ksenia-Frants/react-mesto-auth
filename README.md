# Project: Mesto-React

## Description

This is my tenth project work in Yandex-Practicum on the course "Web development". Here I use React learning skills.

In my project work, an application for adding pictures or photos is implemented. It's like instagram or tumblr. Images can be described and liked. The profile can be edited by entering your name and occupation.

**Basic functionality:**

- Editing an avatar image using a link to an image;
- Editing a profile where the name and occupation are indicated;
- Adding a new photo, by specifying a link and caption to the picture;
- Deleting your card when you click on the trash icon;
- Adding and removing likes, you can also see the number of likes from other users;
- Opening a full-size photo

The work was done according to the layout of figma.
