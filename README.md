# Project: React-mesto-auth

## Description

In my project work, an application for adding pictures or photos is implemented. It's like instagram or tumblr. Images add with a title and description. You can add a card by pressing the Enter button while in one of the text fields. You can like your own and other people's cards. You can only delete your card by clicking on the trash icon. By clicking on the image in the card, you can open it in full-scale size. You can edit your profile by specifying your name and occupation, and you can change your profile photo by specifying a link to a new image. All popups with forms are closed by clicking on the cross or on the Esc button.

**Basic functionality:**

- Editing an avatar image using a link to an image;
- Editing a profile where the name and occupation are indicated;
- Adding a new photo, by specifying a link and caption to the picture;
- Deleting your card when you click on the trash icon;
- Adding and removing likes, you can also see the number of likes from other users;
- Opening a full-size photo;
- User registration, login

The work was done according to the layout of figma.

**It uses technologies such as:**

- positioning elements;
- adaptive layout;
- grid layout;
- Java Script(ES6) and Browser Operation;
- principles of object-oriented programming;
- Webpack;
- React (Create React App, porting markup to JSX, functional components and hooks)

**Installing and running:**

- npm i - installing dependencies;
- npm run start - starting the server;
- npm run build - start the project build;
- npm run deploy - publishing the build on github pages.

**Plans for completion:**

- Make form validation;
- Block the form submission button if the fields do not pass validation;
- Implement pop-up closure by clicking on the background.
